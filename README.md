- Write a java program to get maxing profit by buying and selling a share from a given set of values. If consider buying only once and selling once.
- You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

```You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

	Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

	Example 1:
	Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
	Output: 5
	Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
	Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
	
	Example 2:
	Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
	Output: 0
	Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

			int stockPrices[] = {7,6,4,3,1};
			int len = stockPrices.length;		
			Map<Integer,Integer> pairs = new HashMap<>();
			for(int i=0;i<len;i++) {
				for(int j=i+1;j<len;j++) {
					if(stockPrices[i] < stockPrices[j] ) {
						if(pairs.get(stockPrices[i]) == null || pairs.get(stockPrices[i]) < stockPrices[j]) {
							pairs.put(stockPrices[i], stockPrices[j]);
						}
					}
				}
			}
			System.out.println(pairs);
			int max = 0;
			for(Entry<Integer, Integer> value:pairs.entrySet()) {
				if(max < (value.getValue() - value.getKey())) {
					max = value.getValue() - value.getKey();
				}
			}
